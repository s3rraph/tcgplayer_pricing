# TCGPlayer Pricing Tool

This is a desktop tool for TCGPlayer Level 4 and Pro sellers that allows you to adjust inventory prices.  
It's designed around working with the export/import CSV files from the Pricing tab on TCGPlayer.

## Features
- Load card data from a CSV file generated by TCGPlayer's Pricing tab
- Apply price adjustments based on:
  - Percentage change of price based on Market or Low, whichever is higher
  - Quantity-based scalers that increase prices further if inventory contains multiple copies of a card
  - Floor price enforcement
- Export an adjustment CSV that can be loaded back into TCGPlayer

## Usage
1. Run the application using Python: `py tcgplayer_pricing.py`
2. Use the input fields to set your pricing rules
3. Load an export CSV file containing your card data
4. The table will update with calculated prices
5. Export the updated CSV when you're ready
6. Import the updated CSV into TCGPlayer staged inventory
7. **REVIEW THE PRICES!!!!!!!**
8. Move staged inventory changes to live

## Notes
- If you're not a Pro seller or don't use the My Store website, you can ignore the My Store section and uncheck "Include My Store Price in Export"
